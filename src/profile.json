This ensures that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information or perform certain actions, safeguarding the integrity of the certification process. The application also boasts an efficient and user-friendly Admin Panel, empowering administrators with the necessary tools to manage users, resources, and access permissions effectively. Through the Admin Panel, administrators can monitor user activity, grant or revoke access privileges, and oversee the overall functioning of the platform. Overall, the ISOP certification application is a comprehensive and secure solution that empowers users to navigate their certification process with confidence, leveraging advanced authentication mechanisms and an intuitive Admin Panel to streamline their experience and ensure compliance with ISOP standards.",
